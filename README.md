# 6DOF-Robot-Arm

Using a 6 Degree Of Freedom Robot Arm, mapped to grab and place chess pieces on a chess board. The specific squares were hardcoded and the arm simply grabs the piece and places it on the specific squares. Details on the work and issues faced in the project are mentioned in detail in the Report and the Fritzing Sketches.
 
#Version 1: Used arduino conencted to a 7.5V 2A power supply, to power all 6 Servo motors of the arm.

Demonstration:


#Version 2: Tried using a PCA9685 Motor driver to drive all 6 Servo motors of the arm.

#Version 3: Powered the Arm directly using 5V 5A Power Supply.

Demonstration:


#Motion Prototype: Using Version 3, used a MPU6050 Gyroscope to motion control the arm on the X and Y axis
